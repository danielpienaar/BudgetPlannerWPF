2nd Year C# Programming Project done in WPF. A budget planner that records and calculates your expenses and savings.

### How to run the program:

<br>

As part of the requirements we were told to create a user manual. If you would like to see more detail about how the pprogram works, feel free to open the UserManual pdf file.

* Open Visual Studio. Make sure you have .NET version 5 installed as this program uses that version. Open the file named "BudgetPlannerWPF.sln" to see it in the IDE. Alternatively, you could go to BudgetPlannerWPF\bin\Debug\net5.0-windows and run the exe directly, if you would prefer to not open visual studio.
* Click the "Start Without Debugging" button at the top of the editor, or alternatively press ctrl+f5.
* A window with a menu on the left will appear. Click on the first available button to begin entering your information.
<br><br>
**NOTE:** All prices should contain numbers and a '.' for the decimal place. Any misinputs will simply result in the textbox of the incorrect data being highlighted in red. Note that commas (",") do not represent decimal places in price values.
<br><br>
* Once you have entered the general financial information, you will be shown a message box to choose between renting or buying a property.
* You will then be asked if you would like to buy a vehicle. Selecting Yes will take you to the vehicle page, selecting No will skip the vehicle page and open the report page. If you change your mind, you can re-submit the home data to choose again.
* When you are finished, and all the categories have been correctly filled (the menu buttons will turn green) the report page will be shown. This contains a list of your expenses, and options to save money at the bottom.
* If you would like to change or re-enter data, simply click on the button for the data you wish to change. The report page will be updated accordingly, after re-submitting the required data.
